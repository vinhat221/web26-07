      <h1> About me</h1>
        <p class="content-small">Modern society is constantly developing, and the appearance of the Internet has opened
            up a whole new era of access and sharing of information. This brings a tremendous reform and benefits to all
            humanity. In our lives there are innumerable questions that need to be answered, and the Internet was born
            as a useful tool to help us solve those questions. Searching for information in the past has cost humanity a
            lot of time and effort, and not everyone had patience to turn the pages one by one to find the information
            they needed. However, our lives have changed tremendously since the arrival of the Internet, and the search
            of general information on the Internet has not consumed us much more than mouse clicks and keyboard typing.
            This is where most basic and specialist information is gathered from the majority of occupations and fields
            in our life. There are countless websites that contain useful information for research and study, and
            Wikipedia is now considered to be the most complete and accurate encyclopedia. Searching the Internet is
            simple, but we should also be careful in getting that information. Not all knowledge on the Internet is
            accurate and complete, so we need to compare information from many different sources before actually using
            any of them for our purposes. The Internet is an infinite ocean of knowledge, and we can learn countless
            things if we know how to use it properly.</p>

Meanwhile, according to data, while the average change in society in developing countries is positive, in richer countries this can be exactly the opposite. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this? Traditional classrooms in the past held lectures with multiple participants. Now that technology makes it easier and faster for students to access information, the need for traditional classroom discussion is becoming less popular. Itâ€™s because the internet is a more effective method than the regular classroom. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? What is your personal opinion? Many big companies in the world are undergoing processes of modernization. What are the benefits and consequences of this modernization? With the rapid advancement of communication technology, e.g. smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices, some people believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Maintaining public libraries is a waste of money since computer technology can replace their functions. Do you agree or disagree? In the modern world, mobile and smartphone use has become universal in most parts of the world. Although there are clearly many advantages of this technology, there are many who believe it also brings many disadvantages. Discuss both points of view and give your opinion..</p></th>
